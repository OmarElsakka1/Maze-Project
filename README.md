# Maze-Project
The maze project

The whole story started while doing my first portofilo project for ALX Software Program. I have to find the idea for my first project in this program. I heard about the Maze project the first time from this point.

The idea of converting the 2D Maze to a maze that the agent can move in, this can be applied using math.

# installation
git clone https://github.com/OmarElsakka1/Maze-Project.git

# Running the project

make run

# Usage
use the four arrows for movement in the maze (Left, Right, Up, Down)
